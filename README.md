# Wordle Helper!
A small application to assist you in wordle!

# How to download:
On the right side of the page, click on the hyper-link under releases to open up the latest release. Click on source-code (zip) in order to download the files. Once you have the file downloaded, right click and extract it anywhere you want. Open the folder it creates and run "Wordle Helper.exe" to use it.

# Explanation:
Open the Wordle Helper.exe file in order to boot up the program.
There is 2 lists of words, the one on the left titled "Next guesses to gain more data" gives you words that dont contain any letters you've already used, therefore giving you words that will yield you the most information.
The second list of words, called "Potential correct guesses", gives you a list of words that may be a correct guess, once this list is down to a little amount, you know that the word is one of those words in that list.

# How to use:
The grid of boxes allows you to enter one letter per box. There is only 1 row of boxes enabled at once. Input the word you guessed in wordle and then using the buttons underneath each letter, click the button until it is the same color that wordle sets that letter to.
Once all the colors and letters match what you have inputted on wordle, press submit and it will update the 2 lists on either side.

Happy wordle-ing!
